# Auth0 - Logs to Elasticsearch

This extension will take all of your Auth0 logs and export them to Elasticsearch.

## Configure Webtask

If you haven't configured Webtask on your machine run this first:

```
npm i -g wt-cli
wt init
```

> Requires at least node 4.2.2 - if you're running multiple version of node make sure to load the right version, e.g. "nvm use 4.2.2"

## Deploy to Webtask.io

To run it on a schedule (run every 5 minutes for example):

```bash
$ npm run build
$ wt cron schedule \
    --name auth0-logs-to-elasticsearch \
    --secret AUTH0_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN" \
    --secret AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID" \
    --secret AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --secret LOG_LEVEL="1" \
    --secret LOG_TYPES="s,f" \
    --secret ELASTICSEARCH_URL="ELASTICSEARCH_URL" \
    --secret ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX="ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX" \
    "*/5 * * * *" \
    build/bundle.js
```


The following settings are optional:

 - `LOG_LEVEL`: This allows you to specify the log level of events that need to be sent.
 - `LOG_TYPES`: If you only want to send events with a specific type (eg: failed logins). This needs to be a comma separated list.

> You can get your Global Client Id/Secret here: https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2

## Usage - pre-requisites

Very simple, but there is some ground work getting setup, in particular if installing locally.

Assuming here you wish to make use of the `ELK` stack - visualizing data with ElasticSearch, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

Here are some instructions on getting setup:

```
brew install elasticsearch
brew install kibana
```

In separate terminal windows (shells), just run:

```
$ elasticsearch
$ kibana
```

If you opted to have elasticsearch and kibana start automatically as a service on startup, then you don't need to explicitly start them as above.

#### Get some data into Elasticsearch

For test purposes only, just run the following:

```
curl -H "content-type: application/json" -XPUT 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/twitter/tweet/1' -d '{ "user" : "arcseldon", "post_date" : "2016-04-23T14:12:12", "message" : "Testing Auth0 integration with Elasticsearch" }'
```

You could do a `POST` request here, and change the URI to be different to `twitter/tweet/` etc.

Change the `user` value as you wish, and also update the `post_date` value to something near realtime. Just be careful here, I would recommned setting it to something like 12 hours earlier than the current time (to get around any timezone issues etc - remember we're doing a barebones test here, so you can sort this out later - we just want to see this work for now).

You should be getting an `ok` response. Run the same command about 10 times just so we have a few entries to play with.


#### Now set up a default index:

Open Kibana - `http://localhost:5601/` - Settings.

Leave `index contains time-based events` ticked.
Just enter `user` for the index name or pattern
For `Time-field name` (which becomes visible after you enter an accepted index name), choose `post_date` and hit `Create`

Now head over to `Discover` from the top nav bar, and enter `*` for the search, and hit enter. You should see your data.

Right, you're setup locally, time to use the Auth0 extension!

## Usage

Install the extension, and inspect your elasticsearch logs with Kibana!


## Filters

The `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to (setting it to a value will also send logs of a higher value):

 - `1`: Debug messages
 - `2`: Info messages
 - `3`: Errors
 - `4`: Critical errors

The `LOG_TYPES` filter can be set to:

- `s`: Success Login (level: 1)
- `seacft`: Success Exchange (level: 1)
- `feacft`: Failed Exchange (level: 3)
- `f`: Failed Login (level: 3)
- `w`: Warnings During Login (level: 2)
- `du`: Deleted User (level: 1)
- `fu`: Failed Login (invalid email/username) (level: 3)
- `fp`: Failed Login (wrong password) (level: 3)
- `fc`: Failed by Connector (level: 3)
- `fco`: Failed by CORS (level: 3)
- `con`: Connector Online (level: 1)
- `coff`: Connector Offline (level: 3)
- `fcpro`: Failed Connector Provisioning (level: 4)
- `ss`: Success Signup (level: 1)
- `fs`: Failed Signup (level: 3)
- `cs`: Code Sent (level: 0)
- `cls`: Code/Link Sent (level: 0)
- `sv`: Success Verification Email (level: 0)
- `fv`: Failed Verification Email (level: 0)
- `scp`: Success Change Password (level: 1)
- `fcp`: Failed Change Password (level: 3)
- `sce`: Success Change Email (level: 1)
- `fce`: Failed Change Email (level: 3)
- `scu`: Success Change Username (level: 1)
- `fcu`: Failed Change Username (level: 3)
- `scpn`: Success Change Phone Number (level: 1)
- `fcpn`: Failed Change Phone Number (level: 3)
- `svr`: Success Verification Email Request (level: 0)
- `fvr`: Failed Verification Email Request (level: 3)
- `scpr`: Success Change Password Request (level: 0)
- `fcpr`: Failed Change Password Request (level: 3)
- `fn`: Failed Sending Notification (level: 3)
- `limit_wc`: Blocked Account (level: 4)
- `limit_ui`: Too Many Calls to /userinfo (level: 4)
- `api_limit`: Rate Limit On API (level: 4)
- `sdu`: Successful User Deletion (level: 1)
- `fdu`: Failed User Deletion (level: 3)

So for example, if I want to filter on a few events I would set the `LOG_TYPES` filter to: `sce,fce,scu,fcu`.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
